# VolcaniQ: a mini-project for seismic attenuation inversion in volcanic data

## Installation instructions

- (with anaconda) create a virtual environment by running in a terminal window `conda env create --file environment.yml`
- activate the new environment with `conda activate volcaniQ`.
- as python dependencies are often updated between commits to the main branch, worth periodically to do a `conda env update --file environment.yml --prune` which updates the environment with the most current dependencies.
